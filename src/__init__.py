"""Package activation helpers for the plugin-img development layout.

This module provides a convenience function `activate_all()` which will
import the plugin subpackages found under this `src/` directory. During
development you can either add `packages/plugin-img/src` to your `PYTHONPATH`
or install the package editable with `pip install -e packages/plugin-img`.

Usage examples:

        # Add to PYTHONPATH (temporary for this shell):
        set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\path\to\repo\packages\plugin-img\src
        python -c "import src; src.activate_all()"

        # Or, after `pip install -e packages/plugin-img`:
        python -c "import src; src.activate_all()"

The function tries to import the common subpackages used by this plugin
bundle so that any parser registration side-effects occur on import.
